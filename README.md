# 3DParticlePath
Plots the path of a particle in 3D using parametric functions. Shows the position, velocity, and acceleration vectors of the particle and the graphs of the magnitudes of each vector with respect to time.
This project was made in Wolfram Mathematica. Download the notebook (.nb) file if you have access to Mathematica.

#Parameters of the path function:
x[t], y[t], z[t]: These are the functions that describe the i, j, and k components of the vector. Set these functions in the code itself.
*The rest of these parameters can be manipulated after the animation is created*:
t0, t1: The inital value of t and final value of t that is to be graphed.
x0, x1: The minimum and maximum value on the x-axis to be seen on the graph.
y0, y1: The minimum and maximum value on the y-axis to be seen on the graph.
z0, z1: The minimum and maximum value on the z-axis to be seen on the graph.
speed: The speed at which the animation runs.
